      <p>[John Tipton, pioneer Indian fighter, soldier, legislator and United States Senator, was a striking example of a certain type that has impressed itself upon
         the
         early history of the western country of America. It is the pioneer type—the uncultured,
         unlettered
         man, the product of a rude society, who, by strong natural gifts has come to the fore
         and asserted
         himself with distinction among the leaders of the land. Tipton, born of pioneer stock
         on the Tennesee frontier, came to Harrison County, Indiana, in 1807, when 21 years old, and is said to have soon taken rank as a leader of the
         law
         and order forces in his neighborhood. Along with a local military company he joined
         General Harrison
         in the campaign against the Prophet's town in 1811, and in the famous battle of Tippecanoe
         acquitted
         himself notably. That he rose by gradual promotion, after this campaign, to the office
         of brigadier
         general is evidence of his military capacity. With the admission of Indiana as a State and the creation of State and local offices he was elected sheriff of
         Harrison County, and served as such until 1819, when he was chosen to represent his district in the
         legislature; and as representative he was re-elected in 1821. When, in 1820, commissioners
         were
         appointed to select a site for the permanent capital of the State, he was considered
         a proper man
         for this important task; he was also appointed a commissioner to act with an Illinois representative in fixing the dividing line between the two States; and in 1823
         President Monroe made him general agent for the Miami and Pottowattomie Indians within
         our borders.
         In 1831 he was elected by the legislature to fill out the unexpired term of U. S. Senator James Noble, and in 1833 he was re-elected for the full senatorial term He
         died
         in Logansport, April 5, 1839, aged 53 years.

      <p>Not the least interesting of Tipton's performances are the journals left by him, which
         throw a light
         on his character, revealing his precise and methodical habit and his keen attention
         to practical
         matters. Two of these journals are of particular value. These are, the journal of
         the Tippecanoe
         campaign and the one here published. Each is the most circumstantial account in existence
         of the
         events chronicled. Of the commissioners' work in locating the capital, there is practically
         no other
         document existent, the legislative reports being exceedingly meager. The original
         manuscripts, once
         owned by John B. Dillon, were found among his effects at his death, and are now in
         possession of Mr.
         John H. Holliday, of Indianapolis. They were published by him in the <i>Indianapolis News</i>, in 1879, the one here printed in the issue of April 17, and the
         Tippecanoe account on May 5. Otherwise they have been inaccessible to the public.
