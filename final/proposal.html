<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
<p>The content of this project will be the works of the 17th century French playwright, Moli√®re. Many of his famous plays have been translated from their original French into English for consumption by a wider audience. He wrote a variety of comedies and tragedies and was a favorite author of King Louis XIV. The intended audience of this project is anyone interested in his plays, typically this is students studying the French language and culture. This project is intended to bring together the original French texts and their translations to help facilitate learning. The preliminary plan of this project is to display the text of the plays in French with the ability to hover over and see the English translation of that line. Since it is dramatic works, things are broken down line-by-line, making it easier to match the translation. This will require encoding 1-2 of his plays, both French and English, into TEI for dramatic works. From there, it will require HTML and CSS coding in order to create the hover. If this fails, then JavaScript may need to be used. I may also explore Scalar to see if this can be achieved with their platform. If all forms of hover fail, then the plays will simply be formatted in HTML to display side-by-side. </p>
