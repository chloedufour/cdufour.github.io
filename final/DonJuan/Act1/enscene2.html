               Of course you are right, because you wish it; one must not contradict you.  But if
               you did not wish it, that would be another thing altogether.

               In that case, Sir, I would say honestly that I do not approve at all of your habits,
               and that I find it deplorable to love on all sides as you do.

               What?  You'd prefer that we'd bind ourselves forever to the first object that takes
               us, renounce the world for her, and never again have eyes for anyone else?  What vanity
               to want to preen oneself on the false honor of being faithful, to entomb ourselves
               forever in one passion, and to be dead from youth to all the other beauties that might
               strike our eyes!  No, no: constancy is only suitable for buffoons: all beautiful women
               have the right to charm us, and the advantage of being seen first should not steal
               from the others the just claims they have on our hearts.  I let beauty ravish me wherever
               I find it and yield easily to its sweet violence and to the places it leads us. I
               would be bound in vain; and the love I have for one beautiful woman does not oblige
               my soul to commit an injustice against the rest; I reserve the right of my eyes to
               see the merit of all, and to render to each the tributes obliged by nature.  Be that
               as it may, I cannot refuse my heart to any love-worthy object I see, and if I had
               ten thousand in my coffer, and a beautiful new face asked me for it, I would give
               it all.  After all, the first stirrings of love are charged with inexplicable charms,
               and all the pleasure of love subsists in change.  We taste an extreme sweetness in
               reducing, by a hundred tributes, the heart of a young beauty, to see from day to day
               the little progress that one makes there; to combat with transports, tears and sighs,
               the innocent shame of a soul to the point of rendering up its arms; to force, at close
               quarters, all the small resistances she puts up; to vanquish the scruples of which
               she makes an honor and to lead her softly to the place where we wish to make her come.
               But let us be master once, nothing more is left to say or to wish; the beautiful part
               of passion is done, and we would sink into the tranquility of such a love, if some
               new object did not come to awaken our desires, and present to our heart the alluring
               charms of another conquest. There is nothing so sweet as to triumph over the resistance
               of a beautiful woman, and in this matter I have the ambition of conquerors, who march
               perpetually from victory to victory, and know no limits to their wishes.  There is
               nothing that can halt the impetuosity of my desires: I have a heart to love all the
               world; and like Alexander, I wish that there were other worlds, so I could march in
               and make my amorous conquests there as well.

               My faith!  I'd say ' I don't know what I'd say; because the way you put things makes
               you seem to be right; and yet it's true that you're wrong.  A moment ago, I had the
               clearest ideas in the world, but your speech just muddied them all up.  Let it be:
               another time I will put my thoughts in writing so I can argue with you.

               I'm not speaking of you, God forbid.  You know what you are, and if you don't believe
               in anything, you have your reasons; but there are some other petty impertinents in
               this world, libertines without knowing why, who play the skeptic because they think
               it becomes them; and if I had a master like that, I would say quite clearly, looking
               him in the eye: 'Do you dare thus to play with Heaven, and do you not tremble to jeer
               as you do at the things that are most holy?  Is it your place, little worm, little
               termite that you are (I speak to this other master, as I said) is it really your place
               to try turning to jest what all men revere?  Do you think that because you are of
               quality, that because you have a blond and well-curled wig, feathers in your hat,
               a gilded coat, and ribbons the color of fire (it is not to you that I speak, it is
               to the other) do you think, I say, that you are so endowed that everything is permitted
               to you, and that one does not dare to tell you the truth?  Learn from me, who am your
               valet, that Heaven punishes sooner or later all the impious, and that an evil life
               leads to an evil death, and that

               Oh!  Stop thinking about all the bad things that might happen; let's think only about
               what can give us pleasure.  The young woman I've told you about is a newlywed, the
               loveliest in the world, and came here with the man that she's just married.  By an
               act of chance I saw these lovers three or four hours before their voyage, and I have
               never before seen two people happier with each other or so bursting with love.  The
               visible tenderness of their mutual ardors moved me; heart-struck, my love was born
               out of jealousy.  Unable to bear seeing them so happy together, spite further aroused
               my desires, and I started delighting in devising ways to trouble this union which
               so tangibly offended the delicacy of my heart; until now my efforts have been of no
               use, but now I am about to resort to the last remedy.  This so-called husband plans
               to regale his mistress today with a walk by the sea.  Without telling you the details,
               everything has been readied to satisfy my love, and I have a small boat and some men,
               and the beauty will be abducted.

               Quoi! tu veux qu'on se lie à demeurer au premier objet qui nous prend,
               qu'on renonce au monde pour lui, et qu'on n'ait plus d'yeux pour
               personne? La belle chose de vouloir se piquer d'un faux honneur d'être
               fidèle, de s'ensevelir pour toujours dans une passion, et d'être mort
               dès sa jeunesse à toutes les autres beautés qui nous peuvent frapper
               les yeux! Non, non, la constance n'est bonne que pour des ridicules;
               toutes les belles ont droit de nous charmer, et l'avantage d'être
               rencontrée la première ne doit point dérober aux autres les justes
               prétentions qu'elles ont toutes sur nos cœurs. Pour moi, la beauté
               me ravit partout où je la trouve, et je cède facilement à cette douce
               violence dont[3] elle nous entraîne. J'ai beau être engagé, l'amour
               que j'ai pour une belle n'engage point mon âme à faire injustice aux
               autres; je conserve des yeux pour voir le mérite de toutes, et rends
               à chacune les hommages et les tributs où la nature nous oblige. Quoi
               qu'il en soit, je ne puis refuser mon cœur à tout ce que je vois
               d'aimable; et, dès qu'un beau visage me le demande, si j'en avois
               dix mille, je les donnerois tous. Les inclinations naissantes, après
               tout, ont des charmes inexplicables, et tout le plaisir de l'amour
               est dans le changement. On goûte une douceur extrême à réduire, par
               cent hommages, le cœur d'une jeune beauté; à voir de jour en jour
               les petits progrès qu'on y fait; à combattre, par des transports, par
               des larmes et des soupirs, l'innocente pudeur d'une âme qui a peine à
               rendre les armes; à forcer pied à pied toutes les petites résistances
               qu'elle nous oppose; à vaincre les scrupules dont elle se fait un
               honneur, et la mener doucement où nous avons envie de la faire venir.
               Mais, lorsqu'on en est maître une fois, il n'y a plus rien à dire
               ni rien à souhaiter; tout le beau de la passion est fini, et nous
               nous endormons dans la tranquillité d'un tel amour, si quelque objet
               nouveau ne vient réveiller nos désirs et présenter à notre cœur les
               charmes attrayans d'une conquête à faire. Enfin, il n'est rien de si
               doux que de triompher de la résistance d'une belle personne; et j'ai,
               sur ce sujet, l'ambition des conquérans, qui volent perpétuellement
               de victoire en victoire, et ne peuvent se résoudre à borner leurs
               souhaits. Il n'est rien qui puisse arrêter l'impétuosité de mes désirs;
               je me sens un cœur à aimer toute la terre, et, comme Alexandre, je
               souhaiterois qu'il y eût d'autres mondes pour y pouvoir étendre mes
               conquêtes amoureuses.

               Holà, maître sot! Vous savez que je vous ai dit que je n'aime pas les
               faiseurs de remontrances.

               Je ne parle pas aussi à vous, Dieu m'en garde! Vous savez ce que vous
               faites, vous; et, si vous ne croyez rien, vous avez vos raisons: mais
               il y a de certains petits impertinens dans le monde qui sont libertins
               sans savoir pourquoi, qui font les esprits forts parce qu'ils croient
               que cela leur sied bien, et, si j'avois un maître comme cela, je lui
               dirois fort nettement, le regardant en face: Osez-vous bien ainsi vous
               jouer au ciel, et ne tremblez-vous point de vous moquer comme vous
               faites des choses les plus saintes? C'est bien à vous, petit ver de
               terre, petit myrmidon que vous êtes (je parle au maître que j'ai dit),
               c'est bien à vous à vouloir vous mêler de tourner en raillerie ce que
               tous les hommes révèrent! Pensez-vous que, pour être de qualité, pour
               avoir une perruque blonde et bien frisée, des plumes à votre chapeau,
               un habit bien doré, et des rubans couleur de feu (ce n'est pas à vous
               que je parle, c'est à l'autre), pensez-vous, dis-je, que vous en soyez
               plus habile homme, que tout vous soit permis, et qu'on n'ose vous dire
               vos vérités? Apprenez de moi, qui suis votre valet, que le ciel punit
               tôt ou tard les impies, qu'une méchante vie amène une méchante mort, et
               que...

               Ah! n'allons point songer au mal qui nous peut arriver, et songeons
               seulement à ce qui nous peut donner du plaisir. La personne dont je
               te parle est une jeune fiancée, la plus agréable du monde, qui a été
               conduite ici par celui même qu'elle y vient épouser; et le hasard me
               fit voir ce couple d'amans trois ou quatre jours avant leur voyage.
               Jamais je n'ai vu deux personnes être si contentes l'une de l'autre et
               faire éclater plus d'amour. La tendresse visible de leurs mutuelles
               ardeurs me donna de l'émotion; j'en fus frappé au cœur, et mon amour
               commença par la jalousie. Oui, je ne pus souffrir d'abord de les
               voir si bien ensemble; le dépit alluma mes désirs, et je me figurai
               un plaisir extrême à pouvoir troubler leur intelligence et rompre
               cet attachement dont la délicatesse de mon cœur se tenoit offensée;
               mais jusques ici tous mes efforts ont été inutiles, et j'ai recours
               au dernier remède. Cet époux prétendu doit aujourd'hui régaler[4] sa
               maîtresse d'une promenade sur mer. Sans t'en avoir rien dit, toutes
               choses sont préparées pour satisfaire mon amour, et j'ai une petite
               barque et des gens, avec quoi, fort facilement, je prétends enlever la
               belle.
