<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a second year MLS student at Indiana University Bloomington. I have been interested in pursuing a degree in library science from a young age, when an affinity for reading would often bring to me the library. Since then, my interests (both personally and professionally) have expanded and I have realized the potential for libraries past books.</p>
